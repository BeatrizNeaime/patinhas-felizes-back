## The Project

Patinhas Felizes is a web application to help animals shelters managing its animals. It was born in 2022 through my Web Development classes, but it was initially built with [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) and [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en) + [Express](https://expressjs.com/pt-br/).

Now, I'm rebuilding it using some of the newest technologies.

## Technologies

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) + [NestJS](https://docs.nestjs.com/) + TypeScript.

- [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/)

- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
